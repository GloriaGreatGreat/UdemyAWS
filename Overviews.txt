Overview of the AWS Platform

AWS Global Infrastructure
  A Region is a geographical area.
  Each Region consists of 2 or more Availability Zones.
  An Availability Zone (AZ) is Simply a Data Center.
  Edge Locations Are CDN End Points for CloudFront.
  There are many more Edge Locations than Regions.

Networking & Content Delivery
  VPC: Virtual Private Cloud; virtual data center, need to build a VPC from memory, really important
  Route53: amazon's highly scaleable DNS service
  Cloud Front: used s CDN to distribute content around the world
  Direct Connect: instead of going through Internet, going through dedicated telephone line to AWS
    because of security reasons, also reliable connection

Compute
  EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud; virtual machines in the cloud
  EC2 Container Service
  Elastic Beanstalk: deploy code to AWS; designed to run a developer's code on an infrastructure that
    is automatically provisioned to host that code
  Lambda: build echo using Lambda; speak to echo is actually speak to Lambda; run code without having to
    worry about provisioning any underlying resources such as virtual machines, databases, etc
  Lightsail

Databases
  RDS: offers the following database engines: SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Aurora, Oracle
  DynamoDB: NoSQL database, super high performance
  Redshift: used primarily for data warehousing
  Elasticache

Migration
  Snowball
  DMS: Database Migration Service
  Service Migration Service (SMS)

Analytics
  Athena
  EMR: big data process
  Cloud Search: search engine
  Elastic Search: search engine
  Kinesis: streaming and analyzing data in real time, collating large amounts of data streamed from multiple sources
  Data Pipeline
  Quick Sight

Security & Identity
  IAM: really important, add users to your AWS account and set password rotation policies for these new users
  Inspector: agent, does security
  Certificate Manager
  Directory Service
  WAF: application level protection, application layer
  Artifacts: documents, certifications

Management Tools
  Cloud Watch: monitor
  Cloud Formation: documents describe AWS environments, turn infrastructure into codes
  Cloud Trail: supply auditors with logs detailing the individual users that provision specific resources on your AWS platform
  Opsworks: you need a configuration management service that enables your system administrators to configure and operate
    your web applications using Chef
  Config
  Trusted Advisor

Application Services
  Step Functions
  SWF: important
  API Gateway
  AppStream
  Elastic Transcoder: your digital media agency needs to convert their media files in to different formats to suit different devices.

Developer Tools
  CodeCommit
  CodeBuild
  CodeDeploy
  CodePipeline

Messaging
  SNS
  SQS: queue
  SES: simple email services

Elastic Map Reduce: designed to assist you in processing large data sets

Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application
health monitoring based on the code you upload to it, where CloudFormation is an automated provisioning engine designed to
deploy entire cloud environments via a JSON script

S3: offers durable, available storage for flat files
Glacier: the best choice for long term data archival
